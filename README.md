# cammUtils-vTigerNetApi

A library written in C# which allows easy access to the VTiger CRM webservice.
It is capable to use every aspect of the VTiger-Webservice as is.

## About
I started this Project as part of an internship at [url:CompuMaster|http://www.compumaster.de] and it was a whole lot of fun to experience working on a project where I could not do as I wish like in my own projects.
And at last, this API would have never existed, if I didn't get that chance by having an internship.
